### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

Here, you can normally find all the projects that I'm working on,  
desktop applications, web development, creative coding, arduino projects,  
but right now it's a little bit more tidy because I'm applying for internships! ðŸ˜Š

I hope you like what you're look into,  
and if any questions should arise,  
don't hesitate to hit me up! ðŸ˜€  
  
Cheers!
